# My C++ tutorial journey
I have been programming in c++ for 5 years for school and never really wanted to learn it for myself I wanted to focus on web dev and python.

Now I have decided to go all in on c++ and become an advanced programmer while still in school so when I am ready to move on to other languages I will be well informed of how things work on a lower level.

If you are reading this welcome to my journey to becoming a software engineer!
